# Step 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Heuristic Evaluation is where a small group of people evaluate a tool based on some basic best practices for all applications, not just those in biology/genomics. This is a great first step because it only takes an hour, it doesn't require you to find potential users of your tool \(anyone who uses the web will do\), and it will catch many of the biggest usability bugs.

To set up a Heuristic Evaluation, gather a group of 2-5 people and give them a specific task to complete using your tool. The task should take no more than 5 minutes to complete. Have them fill out the evaluation form below as they go through the task. After 45 minutes have everyone come back together to discuss how it went and summarize any findings.
